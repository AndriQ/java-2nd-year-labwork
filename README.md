- These are all from a Java course I completed in second year university.
- They are based on card games and the main code files are in the source directories.
- During this course, while I developed my knowledge of Java, I also learnt about design patterns used in object oriented programming, allowing me to understand their importance and how they are useful in many different situations.
- This course enhanced my problem solving skills while also enhancing my proficiency in Java.
